  Required response JSON

      "summary":"string", // what you are trying to do with next action based on what you have done so far. (keep it really short and on point. use less tokens.). keep it in past tense.
      "infoCollected": "string", // All info collected so far to help solve the task (keep it really short and on point. use less tokens.). so everyti time you just have to add new info if required else keep it as is (add t info here only if its relevent to solve the main goal and not there already in  gathered relevent data else keep it empty string).
      "action": { }, / one of the action schemas above
